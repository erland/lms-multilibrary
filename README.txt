5. USAGE
========
This plugin makes it possible to divide your music library into different sub libraries.
As an example this is useful if each family member just like to browse his/her own music and
not the music of the rest of the family.

Slimserver will still scan and contain the full main library, this plugin just makes it possible
to define sub libraries within the main library. 
Sub libraries can be defined using:
- Directory paths
- Genres
- Comment tags

To use the sub libraries you will need the Custom Browse plugin, the standard slimserver menus
will still browse the complete library but using the Custom Browse plugin you can define menus
that are limited to a specific sub libraries.

The easiest way to create a library is from the Multi Libary plugin web userinterface.
